My research interests and activities focus on investigating complex systems as they unfold through time and space using **mathematical modelling** and **data analysis** (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/cv/">projects</a>). I am particularly enthusiastic about wrangling real-world data.

## Methods

At the core of any such system lie _evolution_, its driving force of change, and a _graph_, encoding its structure. To examine how the former affects the latter, and vice versa, I resort to

- evolutionary game theory, population dynamics, and graph theory;
- Bayesian inference, econometric and statistical analysis of data;
- agent-based modelling, computer simulations, programming.

While I am best skilled in these areas, I also have a strong interest in machine learning and (deep) reinforcement learning.

## Coding

I mostly work in ```Python``` and am proficient in, for example:
- ```Pandas```, ```NumPy```, ```h5py```, ```Scipy```, ```Scikit-learn```, and ```Statsmodels``` for statistical data analysis,
- ```Matplotlib``` and ```Seaborn``` for visualisation (in combination with the ```LaTeX``` drawing package ```PGF/TikZ```),
- ```Igraph``` for network analysis,
- ```PyStan``` for Bayesian inference, ```rpy2``` for embedding ```R``` methods,
- ```C```-extension ```Cython``` for boosting performance,
- ```GeoPy``` and ```Folium``` for geospatial analysis.

I have also gained experience in ```Matlab```, ```Mathematica```, ```SQL```, ```C#```, ```R```, ```HTML``` & ```CSS```.
